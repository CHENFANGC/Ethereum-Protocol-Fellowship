## Notes

#### Asymmetric encryption

- first introduced in 1976
- Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) protocol is one of the earliest example of asymmetric encryption without a third party

#### BitTorrent

- breaks a file into multiple pieces, letting each node take a piece and request the rest from each other, instead of always having to ask the server
- this also benefits from the upload download asymmetry of residential internet connection, fully utilising the limited uploading speed of residential internet connection, compared to not using it at all

#### Bitcoin

- by specifying how many leading bits == 0 to adjust the difficulty of PoW, and it's dead easy to verify: look at the leading bits
- hashing function is really the core of blockchains
