The main high level components of Ethereum are execution and consensus layer. These are 2 networks which are connected and dependent on each other. Execution layer provides the execution engine, handles user transaction and all state (address, contract data) while consensus implements the proof-of-stake mechanism ensuring security and fault tolerance.
